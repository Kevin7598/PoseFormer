A group project of ECE4880J (Computer Vision) with knowledge in deep learning, dealing with continuous sign language recognition.

The dataset is available at the following link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OHJLRfLFPWqkxvLBr4KAQg 
   extraction code：0000

**Note:**
For Mac users, the .DS_Store files may cause errors when reading the videos in the dataset. If so, please use delDS.sh in this repository to clear them.

To process the videos, run pose_extraction_norm.py. To run training on PoseFormer, run PoseTrain-Former.py. To test the reults, run test.py. To plot the results, use plot.py.

**Remember to change the directory path for the data after cloning into local codespace.**
